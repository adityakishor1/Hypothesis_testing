# Hypothesis_testing

Hypothesis testing is like being a detective trying to figure out if something is true. You have two ideas: one saying there's no difference or effect (the null hypothesis) and the other saying there is a difference or effect (the alternative hypothesis). Let's say you're investigating if there's a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and those who use cash.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
  There is no significant difference in the average fare between customers who pay with credit cards and those who pay with cash.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
  There is a significant difference in the average fare between customers who pay with credit cards and those who pay with cash.

- **Data Collection:**  
  Collect a sample of fare data from customers based on their payment method (credit card vs. cash).

- **Test Statistic Calculation:**  
  Calculate the test statistic (e.g., t-statistic or z-statistic) that measures the difference between the two sample means.

- **Set Significance Level (α):**  
  Determine the significance level, commonly set at 0.05, which defines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.

- **Decision Rule:**  
  - If the p-value associated with the test statistic is less than the significance level (p < α), reject the null hypothesis (H₀).  
  - If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level (p ≥ α), fail to reject the null hypothesis.

- **Conclusion:**  
  - If the null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the average fare between credit card users and cash users.  
  - If the null hypothesis is not rejected, conclude that the evidence does not support a significant difference in average fare between the two groups.
