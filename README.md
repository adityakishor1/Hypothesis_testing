# Hypothesis_testing

Hypothesis testing is like being a detective trying to figure out if something is true. You have two ideas: one saying there's no difference or effect (the null hypothesis) and the other saying there is a difference or effect (the alternative hypothesis). Let's say you're investigating if there's a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and those who use cash.

# Null Hypothesis (H0): 
There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.
  
# Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):
There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.

You collect evidence (data) by comparing the average fare for customers who pay with credit cards to those who pay with cash. Then, you calculate a number (test statistic) to see if it supports one idea over the other. You set a rule (significance level) for how sure you want to be.

If your evidence strongly supports the idea that there's a difference in average fare between credit card users and cash users, you might reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Otherwise, if your evidence doesn't show a significant difference, you stick with the null hypothesis. It's basically using data to decide if there's enough evidence to support one idea about the population over the other.
